# Data Structure Types
The basic data structures in R can be organized by their dimensionality (1D, 2D, ..., *n*D) and their "likeness" (homogenous vs. heterogeneous).  This results in five data structure types most often used in data analysis; and almost all other objects in R are built from these foundational types:

I have not had the need to use multi-dimensional arrays, therefore, the topics I will go into details on will include the vector, list, matrix, and data frame.  These types represent the most commonly used data structures for day-to-day analyses.

# Identifying the Structure
Given an object, the best way to understand what data structure it is composed of is to use the structure function `str()`:
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# different data structures
vector <- 1:10
list <- list(item1 = 1:10, item2 = LETTERS[1:18])
matrix <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4)   
df <- data.frame(item1 = 1:18, item2 = LETTERS[1:18])

# identify the structure of each object
str(vector)

str(list)

str(matrix)

str(df)
```

# Attributes
R objects can have attributes, which are like metadata for the object. These metadata can be very useful in that they help to describe the object. For example, column names on a data frame help to tell us what data are contained in each of the columns. Some examples of R object attributes are:

* names, dimnames
* dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
* class (e.g. integer, numeric)
* length
* other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object (if any) can be accessed using the `attributes()` function. Not all R objects contain attributes, in which case the `attributes()` function returns NULL.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# assess attributes of an object
attributes(df)

attributes(matrix)

# assess names of an object
names(df)

# assess the dimensions of an object
dim(matrix)

# assess the class of an object
class(list)

# access the length of an object
length(vector)

# note that length will measure the number of items in
# a list or number of columns in a data frame
length(list)

length(df)
```
