[R Vocab Topics](index) &#187; [Numbers](numbers) &#187; Setting the seed for reproducible random numbers

<br>

If you want to generate a sequence of random numbers and then be able to reproduce that same sequence of random numbers later you can set the random number seed generator with `set.seed()`.  

**Example:**

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(197)
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(197)
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
