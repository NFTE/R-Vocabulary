# Specifing Numbers within a Sequence
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
1:10         # create a vector of integers between 1 and 10
c(1, 5, 10)  # create a vector consisting of 1, 5, and 10 

x <- 1:10    # save the vector of integers between 1 and 10 as object x
```

# Generating Regular Sequences 

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
seq(1, 21, by = 2)             # generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 21 by increments of 2
seq(0, 21, length.out = 15)    # generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 21 that has 15 equal incremented numbers
```

<br>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
rep(1:4, times = 2)   # replicates the values in x a specified number of times
rep(1:4, each = 2)    # replicates the values in x in a collated fashion
```
