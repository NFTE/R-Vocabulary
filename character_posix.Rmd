The following provides examples to show how to use the anchor syntax to match POSIX character classes:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x <- "I like beer! #beer, @wheres_my_beer, I like R (v3.2.2) #rrrrrrr2015"

gsub(pattern = "[[:blank:]]", replacement = "", x)

gsub(pattern = "[[:punct:]]", replacement = " ", x)

gsub(pattern = "[[:alnum:]]", replacement = "", x)

```
