# Scraping Data

[R Vocab Topics](index) &#187; [Importing, Scraping, and exporting data](data_inputs_outputs) &#187; Scraping data

The rapid growth of the World Wide Web has significantly changed the way we share, collect, and publish data. Vast amount of information is being stored online, both in structured and unstructured forms.  Regarding certain questions or research topics, this has resulted in a new problem - no longer is the concern of data scarcity and inaccessibility but, rather, one of overcoming the tangled masses of online data.

Collecting data from the web is not an easy process as there are many technologies used to distribute web content (i.e. [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).  Therefore, dealing with more advanced web scraping requires familiarity with these technologies.  However, this section is meant to be an introduction to some of the fundamental tools required to perform basic web scraping.  The following topics will be discussed to a level to get you started in web scraping; however, to advance your knowledge I highly recommend getting copies [*XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R*](http://www.amazon.com/XML-Web-Technologies-Data-Sciences/dp/1461478995) and [*Automated Data Collection with R*](http://www.amazon.com/Automated-Data-Collection-Practical-Scraping/dp/111883481X/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51Tm7FHxWBL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR108%2C160_&refRID=1VJ1GQEY0VCPZW7VKANX).
