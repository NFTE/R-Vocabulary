With over 7000 packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), 1000 on [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org), and countless more available through [GitHub](https://github.com)<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup> its inconceivable to be knowledgeable or fluent in them all (or even a fraction of them!).  Fortunately, to be fluent in R does not mean to be all-knowing but, rather, to have a fundamental R vocabulary.\r\n\r\n> *\"An important part of being fluent in R is having a good working, vocabulary.\"* - Hadley Wickham\r\n\r\nSo what constitutes a fundamental R vocabulary?  This obviously is a subjective question and one I don't care to debate.  However, I believe [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz) provides a great [vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html) basis to build on. The purpose of this project is to elaborate on Hadley's list in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Although information on these functions are available from multiple resources this project provides a centralized means for learning, and sharing additional resources relating to, the fundamental R vocabulary.\r\n2. In addition, I have found myself relying on additional R functions on a routine basis.  As a result, I will add onto Hadley's list with additional vocabulary items I have found useful.\r\n\r\nThe end result, I hope, will be a comprehensive and centralized resource for students and practitioners to become fluent in R.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"ref2\">2</a></sup>  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n# Vocabulary Topics\r\n* [Basics](#basics)\r\n* Numbers\r\n* Strings and Dates\r\n* Data structures\r\n* Data Inputs/Outputs\r\n* Data wrangling\r\n* Visualization\r\n* Statistical Modeling\r\n* Debugging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<sup id=\"fn1\">1.
