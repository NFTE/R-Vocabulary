[R Vocab Topics](index) &#187; [Character Strings](characters) &#187; [Regular Expressions](regex) &#187; [Regex Syntax](regex_syntax) &#187; Sequences

To match a sequence of characters we can apply short-hand notation which captures the fundamental types of sequences.  The following displays the general syntax for these common sequences:

</center>     

<br>

The following provides examples to show how to use the anchor syntax to find and replace sequences:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
gsub(pattern = "\\d", "_", "I'm working in RStudio v.0.99.484")

gsub(pattern = "\\D", "_", "I'm working in RStudio v.0.99.484")

gsub(pattern = "\\s", "_", "I'm working in RStudio v.0.99.484")

gsub(pattern = "\\w", "_", "I'm working in RStudio v.0.99.484")

```
